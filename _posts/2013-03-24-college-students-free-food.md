title: Do college students go to events for free food? 
---

When organizing activities with student groups, I often wonder what effect free food has on attendance. For a recent event with <a href="http://wute.vc">wute.vc</a>, I decided to run a multivariate test through our <a href="http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/how-a-b-split-testing-works">Mailchimp</a> mailing list to see whether including "Free Food" in the subject line affected the open rate. The results were surprising.  

The 837 people on the mailing list were randomly assigned to one of two email subjects: 

**Group A:** 

> [Tonight 8pm] Free Food + Meet with Gaurav Garg, WashU Alum and Venture Capitalist

**Group B:**

>[Tonight 8pm] Meet with Gaurav Garg, WashU Alum and Venture Capitalist


## Results

<table>
	<tr>
		<th></th>
		<th>A (Free Food)</th>
		<th>B</th>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Recipients</td>
		<td>419</td>
		<td>418</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Recipients who opened</td>
		<td>124</td>
		<td>119</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Total times opened</td>
		<td>225</td>
		<td>187</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Average opens per reader</td>
		<td>1.81</td>
		<td>1.57</td>
	</tr>
</table>


The results surpised me because there is no statistically significant difference in the open rate of the emails, but the total times opened is statistically significant (p < .01). I was unable to survey the event's attendants to directly track the number of attendees from each test group, so I cannot draw a conclusion about whether the subject line actually drove increased attendance. I interpret the results as as meaning that those who were offered food showed higher intent to attend based on viewing the emails more times. 

Note that there is significant error - the mailing list is biased toward engineers and outliers could exist. The group A subject line is longer, meaning that it may have been cut off on mobile devices, thus encouraging the group to open the email and read the whole email, independent of the contents of the subject line. 

**Overall, though, this data suggests that college students pay more attention to events that advertise free food!**
