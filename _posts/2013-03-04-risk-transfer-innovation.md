title: Edward Jung's Risk-Transfer Innovation Model
---
*In the technology world, it is easy to narrowly focused on "apps" and ignore the bigger picture of solving more ambitious problems. This post discusses how Edward Jung proposes tackling these types of problems in a dynamic innovation ecosystem.*

Last week during the [Washington University in St. Louis](http://wustl.edu) Engineering Week, [Edward Jung](http://www.intellectualventures.com/index.php/about/leadership/edward-jung) was featured for the Dean's Lecture. Edward Jung served as the Chief Architect at Microsoft, where started [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/). He then went on to co-found [Intellectual Ventures](http://www.intellectualventures.com/), a venture capital fund based on long-term returns using a patent portfolio.

Edward's talk focused on innovation beyond "apps" to solve bigger problems, and the risk-transfer model he believes will drive these projects. The model focuses on organizing, sourcing, and funding large projects that depend on many innovative, and hence risky, subprojects from suppliers. 

The example he used throughout the talk was the [Boeing 787 Dreamliner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner) project, which attempted to unite many innovative components, but failed to account for the effect that a single component failure or holdup would have on the timeline of the overall project. Specifically, he used the example of the LED cabin lighting system, which he claims had a several-month delay that alone cost Boeing hundreds of millions of dollars<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. "An airplane still flies with no interior lights, but nobody will buy it." 

Jung proposed a **risk-tranfer model** to deal with such projects that depend on outsourcing, and applied it specifically to the case of the 787:

1. Three contractors should be hired for each required component. That way, there is redundancy, and it would require the failure of all three component makers to affect the overall project. With the 787 project, he said that his would have reduced many of the delays. 

2. Instead of providing each supplier with a contract and guaranteed financing, he proposes offering 10-year contracts to each supplier that trigger upon successful completion of the intial contract. That way, contractors are only paid if they deliver. 

3. Rather than financing the research and development by these contractors, and hence passing on that risk to shareholders, he proposes that venture capital funds should finance the suppliers. Thus, financial risk is transfered to funds that specialize in more risky assets. Specifically, he stated that guaranteed payout and a 10-year contract provide enough upside to be worthwhile to most venture capital funds. 

As someone who has focused more on application development, this perspective on the challenges of larger-scale problems with so many constituent parts opened my eyes to more radical innovation.

<div id="1"><small>1: Edward repeatedly used the example of the plane's interior lighting as the source of a major delay, and he cites personal converstion with Boeing executives as his source. However, for completeness, I cannot find documentation of a lighting delay and hence cannot verify its veracity.</small></div>
