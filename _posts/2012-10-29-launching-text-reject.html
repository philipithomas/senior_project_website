<p>While waiting to pay at a Steak and Shake near campus last week, <a href="http://twitter.com/andhess">Andrew Hess</a> and I observed a stranger approach our friend and ask for her phone number. Frazzled though obviously not flattered, she gave him her real phone number. Andrew and I knew that there had to be an easier way to handle unwanted suitors. We set out planning, began programming on Wednesday, and yesterday launched <a href="http://textreject.com">Text Reject</a> in five cities. </p>

<p>Text Reject is entered into the WUSTL School of Engineering Discovery Competition, where it is the first product launched by the competition. </p>

<p>Try out the product now by texting (314) 266.0810, or read previous conversations <a href="http://textreject.com">here</a>.</p>
