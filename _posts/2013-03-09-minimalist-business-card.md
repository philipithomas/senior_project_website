title: Minimalist Business Card

<a href="/images/business_card.jpg"><img src="/images/business_card_small.jpg" alt="Philip Thomas business card" /></a>

As dated as paper business cards seem, unfortunately I still get asked for them! Instead of bloating a business card with titles and companies that change, I decided to experiment by putting just one line on mine - my email address: [mail@philipithomas.com](mailto:mail@philipithomas.com).

Here is my rational:

* Email is my primary form of communication

* My name is in my email address

* My website is a subset of my email address

* Upon receiving a business card, most people initiate communication with an email. 

* [Additional contact information](/connect) is on my website
