title: Hacker Cocktail
---
Prior to last semester's finals week, I was introduced to <a href="http://www.kraftbrands.com/mio/energy_mio.html">MioEnergy</a>. The little 'water enhancer' is loaded with caffeine - so I can carry the equivalent of a pot of coffee in my laptop bag, with easy access for late-night coding or studying. While up late working last week, I decided to try making a cocktail with this magic potion. The results were quite tasty.

<h1>Black Cherry NRG Cocktail</h1>
<ul>
	<li>2 oz gin</li>
	<li>1 oz triple sec</li>
	<li>.5 oz Lemon Juice</li>
	<li>Shot Mio Energy Black Cherry</li>
	<li>Ginger Ale</li>
</ul>
Mix gin, triple sec, lemon juice, and MioEnergy Black Cherry in a high ball glass. Mix, add ice, and top with ginger ale and a cherry.

The concoction has syrupy cherry up front, then mellows out with orange and juniper berry.
