<a href="/code-until-dawn-may-2012/">Earlier</a> I mentioned that I went to the <a href="http://schlafly.com/breweries/taproom/">Schlafly Tap Room</a> and purchased a limited-edition aluminum growler, filled with their AIPA beer. The bartender retrieved the new vessel and topped it off with the brew.

I took the beer to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/allnightlong/">Code Until Dawn</a> event, amused that my aluminum growler matched my aluminum Macbook. However, the beer tasted slightly off and I couldn't quite determine what it was. We finished the growler, looked inside, and encountered a surprise. It turned out that the bartender failed to remove a sheet of paper from the growler, likely safety or manufacturing information, which then became saturated in beer, thereby leaching some tree flavor and a fair bit of ink into our beer. This is unacceptable, and I hope that the other 149 aluminum growlers are not sold with paper inside.
