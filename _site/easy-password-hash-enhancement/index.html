The <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/06/08/tech-lastfm-passwords-leak.html">LinkedIn, Last.FM, and eHarmony password leaks</a> this past week have prompted discussion regarding best-practices for storing passwords.

While much of this discussion focuses on using proper hashing algorithms and salts, I propose an additional way to increase password security.

A <strong>standard password hash</strong> looks like this:
<blockquote>hash( salt + password )</blockquote>
The random <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)">salt</a> ensures that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table">rainbow tables</a> must have specificity for the database.

I propose a way to <strong>further enhance security</strong>:
<blockquote>hash( salt + <strong>username</strong> + password )</blockquote>
Add the username, email address, or some other primary key as an additional factor for the hash input. This increases security in multiple ways:
<ul>
	<li>Attackers <strong>cannot precompute a rainbow table for a specific salt</strong> - by having the dynamic username factor in the hash input, there are now two independent factors that must be manipulated computationally</li>
	<li>Accounts with the <strong>same password cannot be identified</strong> by looking at the raw hashes. If a person uses the same password for both a personal and a business account, looking at the raw table in a standard salted password scheme will allow an attacker to conclude that the two accounts belong to the same person, independent of knowing the common password.</li>
	<li>If multiple accounts use the same password, cracking one account's password <strong>does not immediately compromise the other accounts</strong>.</li>
</ul>
While a dynamic salt is not a unique idea, and there are certainly more mathematically-rigorous ways to securely store passwords, the marginal security benefit of a straightforward change like this is high.
