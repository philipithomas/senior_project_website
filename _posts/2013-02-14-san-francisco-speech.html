title: March 14 Speech at San Francisco City Hall
---
<p>

	I am excited to announce that I will be the featured student speaker at a Washington University in St. Louis alumni dinner on March 14 hosted at San Francisco City Hall. After being introduced by Chancellor Mark Wrighton, I will be speaking about campus entrepreneurship and innovation to about 250 bay-area alumni.
