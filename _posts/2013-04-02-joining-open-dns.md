I am excited to announce that, after graduating next month, I will be moving to San Francisco to join [OpenDNS](http://opendns.com) as a Software Engineer. I am proud to be joining a company with roots at [Washington University in St. Louis](http://wustl.edu), and I look forward to moving West next month.
