<p>My <a href="http://philipithomasframe.herokuapp.com/">old philipithomas.com</a> website is now available on <a href="http://github.com/philipithomas/philipithomasFrame">Github</a> as an open-source project, licensed under an <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache License, version 2.0</a>.</p>

<p>I developed this website theme from scratch for philipithomas.com, and used it for about a year. I just recently switched to a wordpress-based website to allow for more dynamic content, and have decided to open-source the old code. So, use the CSS as you wish, and I set up the old site with a settings file that makes adopting it for a personal website straightforward!</p>

<p>The theme is minimalist, and works well for PHP-based projects or static HTML sites. </p>
