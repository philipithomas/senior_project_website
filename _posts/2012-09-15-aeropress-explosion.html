<p>I love my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aerobie-AeroPress-Coffee-Espresso-Maker/dp/B0047BIWSK">aeropress coffee maker</a>, but recently a coffee ground lodged itself where the filter locks on. I was more concerned with having an over-extracted cup of coffee than with having an loose fitting, so I proceeded to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0t7p9L02nA">press</a> the coffee. The seal broke and my kitchen became covered in hot coffee and coffee grounds.</p>

<p>Be sure to fasten your aeropress lid securely!</p>
