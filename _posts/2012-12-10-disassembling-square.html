title: Disassembling the Square Credit Card Reader
---
<p>
<a href="http://squareup.com">Square</a> changes the way individuals and small businesses accept credit card payments. They started this with a simple hardware credit card reader that plugs into the 3.5mm headphone jack on smartphones. </p>

<p>The design for the reader is patented, so the <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US7810729">basic design of the reader is publicly available</a>.</p>

<p>However, I still wanted to see what the circuitry and components of the reader looked like for myself. The pictures that follow are the disassembly of the Square Card Reader.</p>
