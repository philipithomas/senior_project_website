<div class="page-header"><h2>Motivating Example</h2></div>

<p>This project was motivated by a coffee shop that operates 24-hours per day. It already schedules employees in four-hour shifts throughout the week, and employees consist of a mixture of full-time and part-time workers. </p>

<p>Currently, scheduling is done manually by the manager. Because of the long hours of the shop, employees availability on a weekly basis must be considered. In addition, employees have a strong preference for shift, specifically between night, morning, and afternoon shifts. 
</p>
<p>
	Current scheduling software does not meet the needs of the shop because it aims to minimize employee working hours, and because it treats an employee's preferred shift as a hard constraint. In addition, because the shop has few employees and already schedules in 4-hour shifts, the software package's minimization of labor costs provides little benefit. 
</p>
<p>
	The coffee shop seeks new scheduling software that treats employee preference as a soft constraint, in addition to availability as a hard constraint. When provided with the number of employees required for each shift, and with the availability and preferred shifts of each employee, it should return a suitable work schedule. Constraints such as shifts per week and number of shifts per day should be considered. Furthermore, employees who choose not to prioritize shifts should not be penalized during scheduling.
