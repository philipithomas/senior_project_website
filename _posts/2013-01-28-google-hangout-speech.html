title: Anatomy of a Virtual Speech with Google+ Hangouts
---

<h2> Background</h2>
<p>
This afternoon our <a href="http://wustl.edu">WUSTL</a> student group <a href="http://wute.vc">wute.vc</a> hosts its first event of the semester - <a href="http://wute.vc/events">Hangout with Brad Feld</a>. We contacted Brad, and while he was unable to come for an in-person speech, he offered to conduct a <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/">Google+ Hangout</a> consisting of a short speech and an extensive question and answer session. 
</p>
<p>Running an interactive event through Google+ Hangouts opens doors by making it easier to directly speak with influential people while not creating a major time commitment for them. The remainder of this post covers how we intend to run a speech and Q&A through Google Hangouts to an auditorium of about 100 students.</p>



<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
	The hangout takes place in a large lecture hall on campus, and we anticipate an audience of 130 people. Two computers on our end will provide the interface with Brad. 
<p>
	The main computer will display on a large main screen at the front of the room, and its microphone and camera will face the audience. This computer will allow Brad to see and and hear the audience. Its speakers will be connected to the auditorum's speaker system. so that the audience members may hear Brad.
</p>
<p>

	The second computer will sit in the back, and it will be used for audience members to ask questions. The Hangout software will automatically switch the main video feed on the front screen to the person asking the question, and their voice will play through the main speakers. This will make it easy for the audience to see and hear those asking questions. 
</p>
<p>
	When the event begins, the main computer will intiate a <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/onair.html">Google+ Hangout On Air</a> with Brad and the Q&A computer. The <em>On Air</em> feature publicizes the feed, and it allows us to post the video on Youtube after the event. 
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
If you have any suggestions on how to run this event, please <a href="mailto:mail@philipithomas.com">email me</a>. While we do not intend to publicize the feed during the presentation, the full video will be posted on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr3511ApOs8UlxexGCupTRw">wute.vc Youtube page</a> after the event.

<p>If you are in St. Louis, wute.vc invites you to attend the event at 6 PM on the WUSTL campus! (<a href="http://wute.vc/events">details here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> While preparing the A/V equipment for the event, we found that using multiple computers in the room gave too much feedback (causing an echo), so we just used one computer. <a href="/feld-video/">Watch the video of the event here.</a></p>
