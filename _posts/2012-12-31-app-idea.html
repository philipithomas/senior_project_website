title: I have an idea for an app. What next?
---
<p><em>I have been approached by many friends who have ideas for web applications that they wish to implement. The article below is derived from an email I wrote to one such request for direction in building an iPhone application.</em></p>

<p>Building an app is starting a business, and it's no small undertaking. Doing it well requires a manager, a designer, a programmer, and a marketer. In addition, there are legal concerns such as creating an LLC, obtaining trademarks, etc. You also need to consider creating a marketing website and securing domain names. A revenue model needs to be considered - are you making money with ads? Are you charging for the application?
</p><p>
Unfortunately with iPhone development, there are not shortcuts to building an application - it requires a fairly extensive background in computer science. In addition, you often need to code a full server interface (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>) in order to capture and process data well. The concepts are not really something that can be picked up immediately. To give you an idea of the complexity, check out <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/wikipedia-iphone">the source code from the Wikipedia iPhone app</a>. 
</p><p>
It also takes significant time to build an iPhone app - time to plan, months to code, a week to get approval by Apple, more coding time to fix errors, additional time to submit revisions to Apple, etc.
</p><p>
Consider building a web application instead of an iPhone application. You could learn PHP and have a basic functioning website in a month or so. I suggest this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008XCFLTM/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B008XCFLTM&linkCode=as2&tag=sagacionlook-20">Learning PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and CSS: A Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Dynamic Websites <em>(affiliate link)</em></a>. 
</p><p>

That being said, if you wish to find a coder and start building an application, you can take planning steps to help you stand out and to improve your chances of implementing the idea. 
</p><p>

Here is what you are up against: everybody has ideas. You have to convince others that your idea is better than their own. In addition, you have to be ready to forfeit some control - the value is in the implementation, not the idea, so even though you thought of it, you must be ready to give an equal part of your business to those who contribute. This means that if you and a coder want to start building an app, expect each of you to own half.
</p><p>

There is a shortage of coders, so you have to prove that your idea is both valuable and well-thought-out. I already mentioned that the value is in the implementation, not the idea, so you cannot hide your idea. Specifically, asking somebody to sign confidentiality paperwork to hear your pitch will get you turned away immediately. 
</p><p>

In order to entice technical talent to your team, you need to make it clear that you are not asking somebody to build your idea alone. This means building mockups and showing application flow. 
</p><p>

I suggest constructing flowchart of how the application functions. What happens after sign-up? What do the buttons do? You should essentially build a map for the application. For the user flow in <a href="http://textreject.com">Text Reject</a>, we built the whole model in <a href="http://mindnode.com/">Mindnode</a> before touching a piece of code. 
</p><p>

I also highly suggest building wireframe mockups of the application. Wireframes show the basic functions and layouts of the application - essentially a rough draft of the application's look. <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> is quite popular for building static mockups of both web and iPhone apps. You should use it to put together what every screen should look like, and use a flowchart to link the screens. 
</p><p>

Once you have a mockup and an explanation of the flow, then you stand a better chance of convincing a coder to join you. If you get to that stage, you have taken a proactive step in implementing your idea, and you are ready to present this work and pitch this idea to engineers for the next stage of implementation.
