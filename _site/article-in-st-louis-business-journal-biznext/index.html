<blockquote><p>As a WUSTL student and an analyst for Cultivation Capital, the mixture of ambition and talent at Startup Weekend fueled my excitement. On Friday I pitched Kill The Landline, a service to lets people keep the old landline telephone numbers they still use and forward calls to their cell phones. Brian Pitts, an operations engineer at Tropo, and Matt Zuzulo, a journalism student at Mizzou, joined me to create the team. We spent the weekend building the brand, researching our target demographic, and coding the application. At Sunday’s pitch event, we demonstrated a functioning product, and our presentation was well-received by the judges and the audience. We went on to win an honorable mention. More importantly, our team plans to continue development of Kill The Landline. What stood out most from the Columbia startup scene was the altruism of its members — at times, it was difficult to tell the mentors from the participants because of how openly they helped each other.</p>
