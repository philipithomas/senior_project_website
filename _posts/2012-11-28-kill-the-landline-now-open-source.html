<p><a href="http://www.killthelandline.com">Kill The Landline</a> was our <a href="http://columbia.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend Columbia 2012</a> project. The system targeted baby boomers that owned a cell phone, but still paid for a land telephone line because they had used it for decades. People still called a customer's old number, but their cell phone was their primary method of communication. However, maintaining a landline cost around $30/month.</p>

<p>Kill The Landline was built to keep an old landline number, but forward it to one or more cell phones. We priced it at $10/month with <a href="http://tropo.com">Tropo</a>, and it would take roughly a week to transfer a number to our system. </p>

<p>While the pitch won an honorable mention at the event, the software was never completely finished, and we did not continue building a business. Hence, we decided to publish the code from Kill The Landline, both as an example of a Tropo application, and as an example of what a team of three can produce at Startup Weekend. </p>
