title: Transcript of San Francisco Speech to WUSTL Alumni
---

*Last night I had the privilege of addressing 500 alumni of Washington University in St. Louis at San Francisco City Hall. I was the featured student speaker at a dinner for Bay-area alumni. Below is the transcript of my speech about innovation and entrepreneurship at the university. A video is forthcoming.*

When I was in preschool, the teacher told my parents that I asked the question “why?” too much. “Why can’t I do this?” “Why does this exist?” As I’ve grown older, I never really stopped asking why. 

When I started at Washington University three and a half years ago, I found myself surrounded by people asking the same question: “Why?”

Current sophomore Blake Marggraff asked, “Why can’t I poll a group of people in real-time?” Thank you for coming tonight with your family, Blake. He saw an opportunity to increase student feedback during lectures, so he envisioned [PackSay](http://packsay.com), a real-time voting application, he put together a team, and he just finished a prototype. Stay tuned as Packsay prepares for launch.

In an Engineers Without Borders meeting, six undergraduate engineers asked, “Why is a spirometer so expensive?” They went on to invent a device that cost one one-hundredth that of current spirometers, and started a medical device business - [Sparo Labs](http://sparolabs.com) - that just took second place in the Olin Cup, awarded by the [Skandalaris Center for Entrepreneurial Studies](http://sc.wustl.edu). 

Computer science student Spencer Hewett asked, “Why is the checkout line so slow?” so he devised [NoQ](http://noq.io), was awarded a [Peter Thiel Fellowship](www.thielfellowship.org), and graduates from the Winter class of [YCombinator](http://ycombinator.com). Thank you for joining us tonight, Spencer.


And today, the question I hear more and more on campus is, “Why don’t we build a solution?” And, more often, the answer has become “Let’s do it” from their friends, and “Let us help” from the university. Today I want to share two short stories that define my experience at Washington University - starting wute.vc, and launching Text Reject. 

At meetings of the Washington University Tech Entrepreneurs, also known as [wute](http://wute.org), passionate students have been incubating each other based on what they know, and projects come from the proactivity of the members. It’s an inspiring atmosphere that drove me last summer to ask the question: “Why don’t we share the entrepreneurial culture from wute with students on a larger scale?”

So, I started a speaker series about venture capital and innovation, called [wute.vc](http//wute.vc). We didn’t apply for funding, we had no formal plan - we just followed an idea. Professor Holekamp from Olin, and also a general partner at Cultivation Capital, immediately offered to advise us. 

To secure our first speaker, we just started emailing people that we thought were interesting, and someone responded - [Alexis Ohanian](http://alexisohanian.com), a Reddit founder, was coming through on a bus tour and wanted to talk to students about how he raised funds for Reddit, and about the lessons he learned that fuel his current angel investing. 


It turns out that, when running a large event, not everything goes according to plan. Fortunately the university was there to help us out. Three business days before the speech we discovered that, due to a scheduling mix-up, our reserved venue was unavailable. Fortunately, Dean Quatrano stepped in to help, and he gave us access to all available Engineering spaces. Thank you for the rescue. In addition, when Alexis asked for a hotel room, the Engineering [Discovery Competition](http://engineering.wustl.edu/disc-comp.aspx) provided one. 

Alexis Ohanian packed an auditorium with over 200 students, and he created a lasting impression on campus about the power of entrepreneurship. I even ended up driving him in my car to another speech he was giving, and my back seat was stuffed with students who wanted just another 10 minutes to hear his stories. I still keep in contact with Alexis, and he plans to return to the university this Fall after the release of his upcoming book.

wute.vc was started almost on a whim,  but the university provided the resources to make sure that those with passion can achieve their goals. 

The second story I want to share is about the creation of [Text Reject](http://textreject.com).  The idea for Text Reject struck me and fellow Systems Engineering student [Andrew Hess](www.linkedin.com/pub/andrew-clayton-hess/20/83/4) late one night at a Steak and Shake near campus. Thank you, Andrew, for also joining us tonight. At the restaurant, a stranger asked one of our friends for her phone number, and she reluctantly gave it to him to avoid the awkwardness of saying “no.” Andrew and I asked, “Why isn’t there a better way to avoid giving out one’s number to unwanted suitors?” 


So, the following weekend Andrew and I built Text Reject. We have prank phone numbers that, when texted, fake a short conversation, then tell the person that they have been rejected and post the whole exchange to our website, [TextReject.com](http://textreject.com). 

While building and branding the website, we found support from other students. Some were willing to test our buggy system when it launched at 3AM on a Friday night. Others, like [Ariana Montanez](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ariana-montanez/66/ba0/7a1) from the College of Art, responded to my 4am plea for help with a logo. In fact, she had a dozen variations ready before lunch that day, all because she thought the idea was cool, and she wanted to help. 

We found support from the university in helping to get initial traction. The university’s news department helped spread the word, and we were invited to [demo the system live on tv](http://www.philipithomas.com/me-on-fox-2-news-for-text-reject/) at a local news station. 

The staff from the Skandalaris Center encouraged us to join startup competitions. With their help, we became semifinalists in the national [Student Startup Madness](http://studentstartupmadness.com) competition, and we are currently semifinalists for an $50,000 [Arch Grant](http://archgrants.org). What makes us most proud, though, is that Andrew and I have yet to be pranked with our own system!

Having rejected thousands of people, Andrew and I are excited by the early traction of Text Reject, and it got off the ground due to the selflessness of Washington University students and the support of the university.

Students are leading the growth of a startup community at Washington University in St. Louis, and the university has been building the infrastructure to catalyze that growth. The dialogue between passionate students of different backgrounds creates spontaneous innovation and creation, and when students make that first step on a new project, they find that they are supported and accelerated by alumni who blazed those paths before them. Your continued support will help develop new stories of innovation, like that of Blake and PackSay.

So, when students are able to answer that persistent question of “Why?”, we see that the common piece to all the answers has been the community and support of Washington University in St. Louis. 

Thank you, everybody, for coming tonight, and thank you for extending the spirit of Washington University to the Bay area.
