<p>As dated as paper business cards seem, unfortunately I still get asked for them! Instead of bloating a business card with titles and companies that change, I decided to experiment by putting just one line on mine - my email address: <a href="mailto:mail@philipithomas.com">mail@philipithomas.com</a>.</p>

<p>Here is my rational:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Email is my primary form of communication</p></li>
<li><p>My name is in my email address</p></li>
<li><p>My website is a subset of my email address</p></li>
<li><p>Upon receiving a business card, most people initiate communication with an email.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/connect">Additional contact information</a> is on my website</p></li>
</ul>
