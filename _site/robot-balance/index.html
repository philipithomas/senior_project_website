<p>My lab partners and I spent a  semester in the Robotics Laboratory class at Washington University in St. Louis coding the system for robot in the above video. What is amazing is there is only one motor, and it controls the arm that moves left and right. The blue baton swings freely.</p>

<p>We built a system in Simulink and Matlab that swings up the baton and balances it upright - similar to trying to balance a pencil on your finger tip. The core of system is a mathematical model of the baton's movements that is based on system parameters calculated using Lagrangian mechanics.</p>
