<h2>The Problem</h2>
I purchased a limited-edition growler of Schafly AIPA from the Schafly Tap Room, drank the contents, then discovered that the bartender had left a safety paper in the aluminum growler prior to filling it. <a href="/schlafly-growler-failure/">Details here</a>.
<h2>The Follow-Up</h2>
I posted <a href="/schlafly-growler-failure/">my article</a>, shared it via <a href="http://twitter.com/philipithomas">twitter</a>, and was subsequently contacted by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/troikabrodsky">Troika Brodsky</a>, the Communication Director at Schafly. He immediately contacted all the bartenders working with the aluminum growlers and told them to check for the paper in the bottles. He also emailed me and offered a free  replacement growler of beer.
<h2>The Redemption</h2>
I brought my empty aluminum growler (sans paper) to Schafly Tap Room and received a free growler of a beer of my choice. I chose Bier de Garde and enjoyed it with <a href="http://israelvicars.com" rel="nofollow">Israel Vicars</a> while working on <a href="http://automationkit.com">Automation Kit</a>. While it was not my first time having the brew, I appreciated the earthy, Saison-like characteristics of the Biere de Garde.

The prompt response by Schafly via social media impresses me as Director of Social Media at <a href="http://evetos.com">evetos</a>, and the efficaciousness of the response shows that the company regards digital channels such as Twitter as important in their long-term business plan. I applaud them for such a rapid and responsible reaction to my post.
