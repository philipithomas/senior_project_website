<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I signed up for the service <a href="http://matchist.com">Matchist</a> after their popular Hacker News launch. Matchist provides a service that matches freelance developers to projects, and it couples that service with escrow accounts to ensure prompt payment.</p>

<p>Matchist features "Partners" such as Zapier and Kissmetrics that refer clients to Matchist. It is unclear whether these partners receive compensation for referrals.</p>

<p>I've had the occasional match for a project through Matchist, but have not yet completed a full project through the system. As a developer, coupling deal flow with payment accountability intrigues me.</p>

<h2>A Normal Match</h2>

<p>This afternoon I received a notification from Matchist that my skills matched the expressed needs of a new project. The posting stated:</p>

<blockquote><p>I have Google Analytics set up for my e-commerce website, but I am not optimizing it to its full potential. We need someone to show us what data is most relevant and important, get customized reports set up</p></blockquote>

<p>The project description then specifically stated that they sought "conversion funnel tracking" and "a sales generated report of different campaigns." At the end, they stated "We may use Kissmetrics instead, and will need help implementing that and get the same information as described above."</p>

<p>I have experience implementing this type of system using <a href="http://mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a>, so I clicked the "interested" button on the project in Mixpanel. The client confirmed my eligibility, "matching" me to the project.</p>

<p>I sent a quick follow-up message to the potential client:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>[client name]</em>,</p>

<p>Have you considered using Mixpanel?
http://mixpanel.com</p>

<p>They specialize in funnel analysis. Implementation is mainly on the front-end with Javascript.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Matchist Personally Responds</h2>

<p>A few minutes after I sent that message to the client through the Matchist system, I received this message from Stella Fayman, a co-founder of Matchist:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey Philip,</p>

<p>I saw your message to <em>[client name]</em>:</p>

<p><em>[client name]</em>,</p>

<p>Have you considered using Mixpanel?
http://mixpanel.com</p>

<p>They specialize in funnel analysis. Implementation is mainly on the front-end with Javascript.</p>

<hr />

<p>KISSmetrics is our partner, and Mixpanel is a competitor that provides an almost identical product. Your mission here is to connect with the client and see how you can help her implement KISSmetrics, which is what she is asking. It is troublesome that your initial message points her to another tool. In the future, initial messages should be a description of your skills and why you're interested in the project.</p>

<p>Make sense?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Stella</p></blockquote>

<p>On a personal level, I was offended that Matchist had been personally reading my confidential message with a potential client. In addition, they were monitoring the communication to push their "Partners" into deals, even when the client expressed openness to different analytics suites in the posting.</p>

<p>So, I did some digging.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I replied to Stella, telling her that I felt that her actions violated the stated terms of service, and that I had privacy concerns about the system. I then requested the deletion of my Matchist account.</p>
