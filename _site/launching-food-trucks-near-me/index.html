<p>After the previous success of Food Truck STL, I update the platform so that it could be extended to multiple cities. I also set up a new LLC to run the food truck effort, Food Trucks Near Me LLC. So, today I launch <a href="http://foodtrucksnearme.com">Food Trucks Near Me</a>: dashboards for local food trucks. </p>

<p>The press release is available <a href="http://www.foodtrucksnearme.com/blog/?p=241">here</a> (<a href="http://c15163349.r49.cf2.rackcdn.com/ChicagoClevelandPressRelease.pdf">PDF</a>). The website launches into <a href="http://foodtrucksnearme.com/city/chi">Chicago</a> and my hometown <a href="http://foodtrucksnearme.com/city/cle">Cleveland</a> in addition to <a href="http://foodtrucksnearme.com/city/stl">St. Louis</a>. </p>

<p>I have incorporated much cool technology into the website. Specifically, <a href="http://systematicrevenue.com">Systematic Revenue</a> integration has been fun, with <a href="http://cultivationcapital.com/cultivation-capital-invests-yurbuds-systematic-revenue/">Cultivation Capital having just invested in them</a>. </p>

<p>If you have any feedback on the website, please put it on the <a href="http://foodtrucksnearme.uservoice.com">Food Trucks Near Me Uservoice</a>.</p>

<p>I have decided that, before expanding to many more cities, I need to do a full code overhaul to make the site faster. My project for the weekend is rendering the food truck tweets on the server rather than in the browser, and I plan on a major UI change too. </p>

<p>Stay tuned for more food truck updates!</p>
