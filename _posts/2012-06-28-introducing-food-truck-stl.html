<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>While looking to grab tacos for lunch from my favorite food truck, <a href="http://twitter.com/tacotruckstl">@TacoTruckSTL</a>, I had trouble finding a good unified resource showing all of the St. Louis food trucks and where they were. After some google searches and poking around various twitter pages, I was able to get a feel for where various food trucks were in the city. I decided that a more unified display of the truck Twitter feeds was necessary.</p>
<h2>Food Truck STL</h2>
<p><a href="http://foodtruckstl.org">Food Truck STL</a> provides the mobile food dashboard for St. Louis. The website aggregates the twitter feeds for all of the local food trucks, color-codes tweets based on recency, allows easy access to menus, and more.</p>

<p>The responsive site design works on mobile phones, tablets, and computers.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://twitter.com/foodtruckstl">@FoodTruckSTL Twitter Feed</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Food-Truck-STL/425431314145977">Food Truck STL Facebook Page</a> update every 15 minutes to share the latest St. Louis food truck news.</p>

<h2>Future</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I'm populating the site with menus at the moment. If you have any updates, please <a href="mailto:contact@foodtruckstl.org">email me</a>.</li>
	<li>I believe that the site is up-to-date, but if any trucks are missing, please <a href="mailto:contact@foodtruckstl.org">email me</a>!</li>
	<li>I am working on improving the speed of the website - tweets currently render client-side, and I am working a server-side cache-based rendering that should improve the site.</li>
</ul>
