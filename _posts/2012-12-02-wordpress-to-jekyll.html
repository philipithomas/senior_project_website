title: Switching from Wordpress to Jekyll
---
<h2>Incumbant: Wordpress</h2>
I have used  <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> to manage this personal website for the past two years. Since September, <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=394686&amp;u=680358&amp;m=41388&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=">WPEngine</a> has been my host of choice. The system performed excellently, and it consistently handled traffic spikes with quick load times, as I detailed <a href="/effortless-2-second-wordpress-page-load-times-while-atop-hacker-news/">here</a>. </p>
<p>However, I have been on a discounted trial of WPEngine, so cost has not been an issue. With the trial concluding, I sought a new host becuase the convenience afforded by the service does not justify its full cost. </p>
<h2>Enter Jekyll</h2>
<p>A recent article about the <a href="http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/">technology behind the Obama fundraising campaign</a> piqued my interest. Their network used <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>-generated static pages hosted on the <a href="">Akamai CDN</a> to accept $250 million in campaign donations. Wordpress caching plugins essentially aim to serve the site with static pages, so the idea of generating static pages locally using Ruby then serving a purely static site made logical sense. </p>

<p>Jekyll, however, is not an automated content management system - it requires basic familiarity with Ruby, HTML, and CSS. The technical granularity coupled with the ability to version-control the website with Git appealed to me. </p>

<p>Using a CDN to purely serve a website intrigued me most becuase of the potential for extremely fast speeds with near-infinite scalability. Putting my personal website on Akamai would be like strapping a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kestrel_(rocket_engine)">Kestrel rocket</a> on the back of my Civic. </p>


<h2>Switch</h2>
<p>The full code for my website is availabile on Github <a href="http://github.com/philipithomas/www.philipithomas.com">here</a>. Learning Jekyll and using its plugins proved quite trivial.</p>
<p>The tedious part of the shift was redirecting the permalinks from my Wordpress site to the Jekyll site. My previous website was based on the naked domain, whereas using a CDN requires a subdomain (for a CNAME record). Thus, I had to switch both permalink structure and domain. I did this manually with 301 directs in .htaccess served by <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>. That file is  <a href="https://github.com/philipithomas/philipithomas301/blob/master/.htaccess">here</a>. After putting the redirects online, I then manually submitted a <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1352276">crawl request</a> through Google for each old page. This process, though tedious, preserves inbound links and SEO.</p>
<p><a href="http://rackspace.com">Rackspace</a> offers access to the Akamai CDN through <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public/files/">Cloud Files</a>.  Using Akamai with Jekyll required much tinkering because the platform was not designed to serve a full website. After many calls to Rackspace's truly fanatical support team, I was able to overcome all issues, including caching limitations. I have decided to provide a full guide to interfacing Jekyll with Akamai in a separate forthcoming blogpost in order to cover all of these idiosyncracies in sufficient deal.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p><a href="http://tools.pingdom.com"><img src="/images/pingdom.png"></a></p>
<p>With WPEngine, I consistently clocked page load times under two seconds. With this Jekyll implementation, load times closer to 300ms have been average, with the occassional sub-100ms reading, as shown above (via <a href="http://tools.pingdom.com">Pingdom</a>). While these speeds are outrageous, it is exciting to realize that, with Akamai as a host, this speed is essentially independent of scale, and the network can accomadate nearly any traffic level I could expect. </p>
<p>Of note, though, these page load speeds are so excellent because the site is static content. Making a website scale at these speeds with database queries and sessions would be much more difficult. </p>
