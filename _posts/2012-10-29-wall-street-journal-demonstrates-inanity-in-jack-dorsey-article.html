title: Wall Street Journal Demonstrates Inanity in Jack Dorsey Article
---
<p>This weekend the Wall Street Journal a published piece,<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204425904578072640691246804.html"> Simplicity and Order for All</a>, praising the work of Jack Dorsey, the Founder of Twitter and a Founder of Square. Unfortunately, the article disregards the five other Co-Founders of Square and their important contributions, in addition to numerous other oversights, errors, and sensationalisms. </p>


<blockquote><p>Dorsey has an artist friend, a glassblower, whose business was too small to justify the monthly fees and confusing rules and rates of a traditional credit card swipe machine. One day he failed to make a sale on a $2,000 piece because a customer had no cash on her. "That would've been enough money for him to live on for a month," says Dorsey. "The best innovations come out of real problems and real pain. As I was commiserating with him over our cell phones, it occurred to me that we were both holding up to our ears powerful general-purpose computers. I thought there must be some way we could use them to do easy money transfers."</p></blockquote>

<p>That unnamed "artist friend" is in fact Jim McKelvey, who co-founded Square with Jack, and <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/square-ownership-breakdown-2012-6?op=1">owns approximately 10</a>% of the <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/09/17/square-financing/">$3.25 billion company</a>. </p>

<blockquote><p>Soon enough, Dorsey had engineered a tiny swipe reader that could plug into the headphone jack of an iPhone or iPad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, Square credits Jim with engineering the hardware, <a href="http://news.priorsmart.com/square-v-rem-holdings-3-l3t2/">according to their legal filings on the relevant patent</a>, not Jack. Jack is credited with writing the server-side application, and Co-Founder Tristan O'Tierney is credited with writing the iPhone application (<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/422785/the-new-money/">source</a>). </p>

<blockquote><p>And companies like Visa and American Express are strongly motivated to prevent Square from acquiring enough clout to shove them aroundâ€”and Have been backing the competition with this in mind.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This contains a major oversight -  <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/04/27/visa-backs-jack-dorseys-square/">as reported by the Wall Street Journal</a>, Visa is an investor in Square.  It is not motivated to back the competition.</p> 

<p>This article by Seth Stevenson both contains blatant factual inaccuracies and demonstrates dishonor to the contributions of the other five co-founders of Square. </p>
