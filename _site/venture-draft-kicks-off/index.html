<p>When <a href="http://www.israelvicars.com" rel="nofollow">Israel Vicars</a> and I co-founded <a href="http://automationkit.com">Automation Kit</a> this summer, one of our early clients was the <a href="http://bwedc.com">Brandon Williams Economic Development Corporation</a>. They came to us aiming to create off-the-field opportunities for professional athletes. Israel and I provided creative direction and technical follow-through for their ideas.</p>

<p>One project they had been working on was a conference aiming to unite professional athletes and venture capitalists. They had already booked space for the conference at SLU, but it remained in early planning stages. Israel and I were able to contribute and help shape the whole conference. One of the most exciting parts was choosing the title, and we coined the name <a href="http://venturedraft.com" rel="nofollow">Venture Draft</a>. </p>

<p>In just two weeks the conference kicks off, and seeing the name along with the early marketing material we created plastered throughout the media strikes me as mildly surreal. With <a href="http://venturedraft.com" rel="nofollow">Venture Draft</a> popping up in business journals and speakers such as <a href="http://daymondjohn.com/">Daymond John</a> of  FUBU and Shark Tank fame scheduled for the weekend, it is rewarding to see what started as an idea become so real. </p>

<p>As a sponsor though <a href="http://automationkit.com">Automation Kit</a>, I look forward to attending <a rel="nofollow" href="http://venturedraft.com">Venture Draft</a> in two weeks! </p>
