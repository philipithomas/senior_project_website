title: The Game of Customer Service
---
<p>An unfortunate pattern has emerged in my life of receiving faulty products or incorrect services from companies. These problems have ranged from the minor, such as goods damaged in shipping, to more major ones, such incorrectly made headphones that left a foam earpiece lodged deep in my ear. Because I have encountered these problems so systematically, I approach fixing them as a game of negotiations. An unintentional hobby in my life has thus emerged, and it is conquering customer support systems. With strategies ranging from leveraging social media to activating little-known insurance policies on credit cards, my competitiveness has caused me to persevere and satisfactorily fix nearly every problem. This past November, I encountered my greatest challenge yet, for I needed to think in creative ways to amend the situation. After systematic overbilling by AT&amp;T over the period of five months, gaining concession from their customer service department ultimately required action by the Office of the Missouri Attorney General. </p>

<p>Upon moving into my first apartment this past summer, I signed up for AT&amp;T internet service through a phone call with a representative. I was promised a rebate for the first year that would reduce the price of the service by about $25 per month. However, the rebate would take two to three months to process, and credit would be retroactively issued for the first two months of service. Because I configured the billing system to automatically charge my credit card each month, it took five monthly billing cycles for me to realize that no rebate had taken effect. I proceeded to spend the next week on the phone with AT&amp;T support to attempt to resolve the problem. I wanted the rebate to take effect, and I wanted the overbilled money returned to me. Little did I know, such simple and reasonable requests would result in an extended donnybrook of unreasonable proportion. </p>

<p>The first two times that I called AT&amp;T support, I spent hours on the phone being transferred from representative to representative. After exhaustingly detailing the problem and my proposed to solution to each of the representatives anew, they would not know how to solve the problem themselves, and thus would transfer me to a department that they felt was better suited to handle the situation. These initial calls ended with promises of being contacted by a manager within a day. Frustratingly, neither call was returned. </p>

<p>Angered by the lack of professionalism, I called back a third time and demanded answers immediately. The problem was revealed to be a misconfiguration in the billing computer, and the rebate supposedly never began for everybody who signed up during that same month. In addition, the $25 per month total rebate that I was offered was composed of two separate rebate offers, and the billing computer could only accept one rebate per order. To further obfuscate the situation, every representative seemed to calculate a different amount of money that I was owed, because they could not decide whether both rebates should be applied. At best, I was offered credit on my account equal to the overbilled amount. I felt offended, for I had no contract with AT&amp;T and hence no obligation to continue as a customer. My goal was to receive a check for the overbilled amount, or to receive bill credit exceeding the amount owed in compensation for their ineptitude. </p>

<p>After six unfruitful hours on the phone over the course of a week, I decided that I needed a new strategy. I pondered other approaches, ranging from activating the fraud protection on my credit card to filing a suit in small claims court. Fortunately, a friend enrolled in law school suggested an option of which I was not previously aware: filing a complaint with the Missouri Attorney General. The Office of the Attorney General in each state acts as a consumer advocate, and reserves the right to investigate and file suit against companies that act illegally. Thus, companies handle complaints from the office seriously, making the process quite efficacious. I wrote a 1465 word complaint alleging fraud and deceptive business practices by AT&amp;T, and submitted it to the Missouri Attorney General. In my detailed and objective description of the problem, I went so far as to allege class action potential to the problem because AT&amp;T alluded that the billing error may have propagated to many customers. The Office of the Missouri Attorney General received my complaint and forwarded it to the corporate headquarters of AT&amp;T. </p>

<p>Three days after the complaint was filed, I received a voicemail from an AT&amp;T representative who stated that she was calling at the request of the Office of the President of AT&amp;T. The phone number she left in the message was a direct line that required an access code. Upon contacting her, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that she had already fully reviewed my case, having read all of the notes from the dozen representatives I had spoken to over the past seven days. While I never learned her job title, I presume that she was in the upper tiers of AT&amp;Tâ€™s support system, for in that four-minute phone call she fully resolved all of my problems. My account was credited in excess of the amount owed and the full rebate was extended an additional six months to compensate for my troubles. My complaint to the Missouri Attorney General had worked, and I could declare victory over AT&amp;T customer service. </p>

<p>My competitive drive helped me to patiently sort out the billing fiasco with AT&amp;T, and my amusement with trying to navigate the customer support system ultimately helped to favorably resolve the situation. While calls to customer support centers are the dread of many, treating the system as a game that can be defeated has ultimately proven fruitful to me. While correcting the numerous poor products and services that I receive with unusual consistency could be construed as tedious, I have turned the errors into opportunities to game the customer service system.</p>
