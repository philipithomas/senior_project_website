<p>I am at Startup Weekend Columbia, and at the launch yesterday I pitched an idea for untethering people from old phone numbers. 40 ideas were presented, and mine was picked as one of the top. 
</p><p>
We are building <a href="http://killthelandline.com">Kill The Landline</a> - a service to forward old numbers to new ones for a low price. Startup Weekend gives us 52 hours build a company, and tomorrow we plan to have a completed product and a working demonstration!
