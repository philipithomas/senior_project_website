<p><em>This post is about a text message-based voting system I built for my student group to use at an event. <a href="https://github.com/philipithomas/wusauce_vote">Fork it on Github</a>.</em></p>

<p>Tomorrow my salsa dance team, <a href="http://wusauce.wustl.edu">WUSauce</a>, hosts its annual dance competition. Every year in the past, we have used paper ballots to collect votes from about 400 attendees to determine a winner.</p>

<p>This year, we decided to take a more efficient route by avoiding paper ballots, so I implemented a Twilio-based voting system that uses text messages:</p>

<p>Results are available to the organizer through a web interface:</p>

<p>I based the application on the <a href="https://github.com/TextReject/twilio-php-framework">twilio php framework</a> we published at <a href="http://textreject.com">Text Reject</a>. It uses PHP code with a MySQL back-end, and Twilio to handle incoming and outgoing messages. I secured the production application with HTTP authentication.</p>

<p>The code is available as an open source project on Github <a href="https://github.com/philipithomas/wusauce_vote">here</a>. Setting it up is fairly straightforward with an existing Heroku account and Twilio account. The array in <a href="https://github.com/philipithomas/wusauce_vote/blob/master/choices.php">choices.php</a> may be modified to change the voting options.</p>
