title: Paperless Resume
---

<p>Paper resumes suck. They are inconvenient to carry around. They are boring to read. There are always multiple versions.</p>

<p>I decided to turn my resume into a website to address these concerns. This makes the site easy to access, and it allows linking to various projects. The site is based on the <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">Spacelab Bootswatch</a>, so design is responsive (try looking at it on your phone!). Storing the site as a <a href="https://github.com/philipithomas/cv-philipithomas">public git repository</a> allows version control and a degree of accountability as changes are made.</p>

<p>Check out the live website <a href="http://cv.philipithomas.com">here</a>. </p>
