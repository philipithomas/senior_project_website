---
<img src="/images/ohanian.jpg">
<p>This summer, I started <a href="http://wute.vc">wute.vc</a> with the goal of allowing students to hear testimonies from venture capitalists and seasoned entrepreneurs regarding their fundraising experiences. Today wute.vc announces its first speaker, Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian. Alexis started Reddit after college, was a member of the first YCombinator Class, successfully raised funds to build Reddit, and finally exited by selling Reddit to Conde Nast. Having completed the dream path of an entrepreneur, he transitioned to angel investing. Alexis' varied background and his role in modern culture will allow him to share valuable insight on venture capital with the student body at WUSTL. </p>

<p>The speech commences at 4:30 PM on October 9. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/263922693729369/">RSVP for the event on Facebook</a>.</p>
