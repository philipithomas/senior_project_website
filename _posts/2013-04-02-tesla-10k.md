title: Red Flag in Tesla Motors 10-K
---

Yesterday Tesla Motors published their [8-K SEC financial filings (PDF)](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-4CW8X0/2399818194x0xS1193125-13-135229/1318605/filing.pdf). The filing contained the positive news that first quarter projections were exceeded, giving Tesla Motors its first profitable quarter as a public company. 

However, the [2012 Tesla 10-K (PDF)](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-4CW8X0/2399818194x0xS1193125-13-96241/1318605/filing.pdf), published earlier last month, contains one piece of information that should not be overshadowed by the surprise profitable quarter. 

The SEC requires every 10-k to include an independent [auditor's report](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditor's_report) of the company's financial data. In general, when reviewing a Form 10-K, basic accounting practices state that one should read this report, and look for statements that the company, "presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company" and that it "maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting." Anything other than this is, in general, a red flag.

PricewaterhouseCooper states in their Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on [Page 92 of the Tesla Motors 2012 Form 10-K (PDF)](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-4CW8X0/2399818194x0xS1193125-13-96241/1318605/filing.pdf) *(bolding by me)*:

> Also in our opinion, the Company did **not** maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control â€“ Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) because a **material weakness in internal control over financial reporting** related to their 
presentation and disclosure of non-cash capital expenditures in their consolidated statement of cash flows existed as of that date. A material 
weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a **reasonable possibility 
that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis**.

Tesla may have been profitable on paper last quarter, but independent auditing from last year shows that this news should be taken with a grain of salt due to the 2012 state of Tesla finances.
