title: Does the 2013 WUSTL Commencement Speaker Violate University Policy?
---

It was just announced that [Cory Booker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker), Mayor of Newark and [active candidate for 2014 Senate](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-11/news/sns-rt-us-usa-politics-newjerseybre90a18m-20130111_1_cory-booker-files-papers-senate-seat), will be the 2013 Commencement Speaker at Washington University in St. Louis. I believe that current policies are being violated by having a campaigning politician speak at a university event without allowing open access to the WUSTL community. 

According to WUSTL Policy on [Political, Campaign, and Lobbying Activity on Campus](http://wustl.edu/policies/political.html): (*bolding by me*)

>A speaker's appearance must constitute a speech, question and answer session, or similar communication in an **academic setting**.

>[. . .]

> Admission to speaker appearances **must be open to the University community** and, if the sponsoring organization chooses (in compliance with other applicable University policies), the general public, without regard to the attendees' party affiliation or support of any particular candidate.  Admission to events may not be controlled by speakers, campaign staff, or any other person or organization not affiliated with the University.

According to the university policy on commencement in the [case of violent weather](http://commencement.wustl.edu/ceremonies/violentweather/):

>Two red tickets and three white tickets are sent to all undergraduate parents. The red tickets will permit admission to the Athletic Complex Field House where the undergraduate Commencement will be held in case of violent weather. The three white tickets permit admission to one of the remote viewing areas where the ceremonies can be viewed on video screens. These tickets must be presented to gain entrance to the viewing areas. Candidates for degrees do not need tickets.

Because not all current students are offered the opportunity to attend the event in the case of violent weather, the commencement policy seems to violate university policy on campaigning politicians. In addition, I have concerns about the content of the speech with regard to university policy, and about the legality of public relations for the event - specifically IRS laws on 501(c)(3) non-profits linking to only one campaigner's website. 

I have contacted the [WUSTL Office of Government and Community Relations](http://governmentrelations.wustl.edu/Pages/Home.aspx/) to understand the steps being taken to ensure that the event meets university policy.
