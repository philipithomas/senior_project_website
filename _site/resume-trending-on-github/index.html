<p>Tonight I published my <a href="http://cv.philipithomas.com">resume as a website</a>, and I released the code as an <a href="http://github.com/philipithomas/cv-philipithomas">open-source project on Github</a>. </p>

<p>In the last two hours, the project has taken off on Hacker News and Github. I'm excited to see it as a <a href="http://github.com/explore">trending repo</a> right now on Github: </p>
