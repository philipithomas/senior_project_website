<p>Next month I graduate from engineering school, so two weeks ago I started actively pursuing a software job for after graduation. This wasn't my first time looking for a post-graduation job: I started looking back in November, and I had many problems - the main one being that the startups where I wanted to work lacked the runway to make hiring committments so far in advance. The second difficulty I found with pursuing jobs at startups in November was that they were nowhere as good at the hiring process as large companies.</p>

<p>So, I postponed my job search. I imposed a new start date of spring break with the hope that making a hiring committment a month out, rather than six, would be more realistic for startups. Realizing that I could use some cleverness to make the hiring process smoother, I implemented a variety of techniques inspired by inbound marketing to gain a foot in the door at my desired comapnies. I set up a landing page here on my personal website, multivariate tested a call to action with Optimizely, and tracked visitor engagement with Mixpanel.</p>

<p>It worked.</p>

<h2>Landing Page</h2>

<p>First, I built a landing page here on my personal website. The goal was to engage visitors with content about my abilities and projects, then  drive them to contact me about an interview.</p>

<p><a href="/images/hire_me.jpg"><img src="/images/hire_me_small.jpg" alt="Hire Me Page" /></a></p>

<p>A better landing page would have had a place for the user to enter their email so I could contact them, but my personal website is built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, so there was no dynamic backend to handle this. Rather than build some type of Javascript API or use a solution like Mailchimp, I just placed my email on the page and tracked clicks on the email address.</p>

<p>I linked to my <a href="http://cv.philipithomas.com">resume</a> and <a href="http://github.com/philipithomas">Github</a>, among other pages, to build credibility.</p>

<h2>Optimizely</h2>

<p>In order to get potential employers to view the landing page, I included a prominent link to it on my site's navigation. I planned to acquire traffic with blog posts, then funnel those visitors to the landing page where they ostensibly contact me about an interview.</p>

<p>The button linking the blog posts to the landing page was  possibly the most important part of the process, so I used . To figure out the best way to increase the visitors to the page, I multi-variate tested the button leading to the job page using <a href="http://optimizely.com">Optimizely</a>.</p>

<p>Optimizely is a SaaS that makes multivariate testing easy - just drop in their Javascript on your website, and use their GUI to specify the changes you want. I heard about Optimizely through articles about the Obama campaign - they used Optimizely extensively to increase donations, with <a href="http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/">amazing results</a>.</p>

<p>I randomly assigned visitors to one of three possible buttons on the sidebar leading to the landing page: "hire me", "hiring?", or "for hire".</p>

<p>After running the experiment for 18 days with 2924 visitors, there was a clear winner for the most effective button based on the clickthrough rate:</p>

<table class="table">
    <tr><th>Button Text</th><th>Vistors</th><th>Button CTR</th></tr>
    <tr>
        <td>hire me</td>
        <td>1005</td>
        <td>6.8%</td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>hiring?</td>
        <td>936</td>
        <td>7.2%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>for hire</td>
        <td>983</td>
        <td><strong>8.2%</strong></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p>Note that there are two major problems with the validity of these results. The first is that these posts had a general audience, so the results are for a general audience, not recruiters specifically. Second, clickthrough rate did not necessarily correlate to follow-through by the visitor. To provide additional data on the latter problem, I used Mixpanel.</p>

<h2>Mixpanel</h2>

<p><a href="http://mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a> provides an analytics SaaS that focuses on  an individual visitors' progress toward a goal. I used it <a href="http://support.optimizely.com/customer/portal/articles/605823-how-can-i-integrate-optimizely-with-mixpanel-">with Optimizely</a>. I found that about one in 3 visitors who came to the landing page left it almost immediately after clicking on my resume button. I didn't include Mixpanel tracking on the resume, but it also includes my contact information, so this stopped me from being able connect clicks on my email address to the Optimizely campaign.</p>

<p>I think the #1 way to improve this camaign would be an improved landing page. Specifically, a cleaner layout with less links and an email entry form would be better. Creating an email form, rather than just putting my email address, would have allowed for tracking a specific person's actions in Mixpanel, rather than estimating it based on contact times. In addition, I think that my <a href="http://cv.philipithomas.com">resume</a> should have been integrated with the landing page instead of making them separate.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>I was fortunate enough to be giving a <a href="/san-francisco-transcript/">speech in San Francisco</a> just after kicking off the digital campaign. I met with many people while in San Francisco - at the event, at pre-arranged meetings, and even hanging out at coffee shops. I funneled people from in-person meetings to my website with <a href="/minimalist-business-card/">business cards</a>.</p>

<p>Due to a mix of networking, blog traffic, and outreach to companies, starting about a week into the campaign until it concluded 10 days later, I averaged 3 interviews per business days between nine total companies, all of which I was strongly interested in joining. Of note, I can attribute being ocntacted by at least 3 of those companies directly to the digital campaign. In fact, I received an email from one company stating that they enjoyed one of my articles, then they followed up 5 minutes later with another email saying, "We see that you are looking for a job - CC'd is our hiring manager!"</p>

<p>I was offered a job at my #1 choice in company - <a href="http;//opendns.com">OpenDNS</a> - and I <a href="/joining-open-dns/">accepted the offer</a>, canceled many outstanding applications, and ended the campaign. My introduction to OpenDNS long predated this digital campaign, so I cannot say that this experiment directly got me a job, but I am sure that many of my interviewers visited the website and the landing page before talking with me.</p>

<p>Overall, this experiment was successful, and the data from the analytics software shows that even hiring can be optimized. If you are seeking a job or freelance clients, I suggest setting up a personal website and trying out these techniques.</p>
